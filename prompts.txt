I have an APUSH final project on wether we really went to the moon or not. let me give you teh directions:  Who Fired First at Lexington and Concord? The Assassination of JFK Chem Trail Theory  MH-370/TWA Flight-800 The Illuminati/Free Masons Amelia Earhart Lincoln's Assassination Escape from Alcatraz The CIA and Mind Control Moon Landing Pearl Harbor Was Allowed to Happen  Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon Beatles Conspiracies (Multiple) Area-51/Roswell Elvis/Tupac/Kurt Cobain/Biggie Smalls Salem Witch Trials FDA Withholding Cancer Cures DB Cooper Roanoke- The Lost Colony Other (MUST BE APPROVED BY TEACHER) For this topics project, you and your group will select one tobie from US history that you would like to study in more detall than we did in class. You will have two class periods to complete research and develop a presentation. Directions: 1. 2. Form a group of no more than four people - you mav also work individually or in grouns of tua or three, Choose a topic to research - you may select from the list below or you may choose another and have it approved b Other Options: -A different conspiracy in US history that you are interested in studying - Lesser known historical figures & their accomplishments (William Dawes, Charles Deslondes Alonzo Cushing, Dangerfield Newby etc.) -A topic you wish we would have studied more (women's suffrage, Space Race etc.) 3. Complete research on your topic. Remember, this is not an in-depth research paper. The purpose of this project is to explore and introduce your classmates on a lesser known topic or person in history. Think of this project as a brief overview/cliff notes of whatever topic you choose. Please make sure all research comes from legitimate sources and, if applicable, encompasses all sides of an issue. 4. Create a presentation on your topic. This presentation must include a public product that can be shown to multiple groups of people. Please be creative here - ideas could include: Museum-style exhibit/artifact with explanation b. Brochure c. Movie/Documentary d. Poster Website Other- must be approved by your teacher Schedule: May 19th & 20th. Introduce projects, form groups, choose topics & assign roles May 21st, 22nd, 23rd, 27th, 28th & 29th - Research and construct project (bring your computers if you need to!) May 30th (A) - Presentations & evaluations June 2nd (B)- Presentations & evaluations, the first background picture is rlly good lik eon the top like a space picture thats nice. Make the website not boring, makit like its a NASA or a SPACEX website, but still remember this is a high school project, so be direct to the point and informative and follow directions. Instead of putting images or videso below add descritpive text ubbles with good amounts of text explaining it, and maybe a timeline too. To add the creative factor add astronaut emoji drifting/floating around the screen, and a satellite thats always revoloving around the cursor and trying to follow it, like it has to be smooth and not stay in one place. be direct like not "apollo 1: fact or fiction?" rather "Was teh moon landing real?" like be that kindof direct not comlpex verbage li,ke posits but just basic words that get the job done. and dont say corny stuff like the great moon controversy, and the unneccessary information or decriptions too taek tehm out just make it nice and simple headlines.  make it the poitn basic but informative and detailed everthign is good but make the cahages i just tld you.
this is good, but for each source keep the link right below, like cite sources and use credible sources of info. have like a section where like it explain the consipary and right below in three sections teh theory it self, the cold war impact and theory it self. Then  and put alleged evidence of the hoax, and then a hisotrical timeline with all this info, May 25, 1961 Kennedy's Lunar Commitment  "We choose to go to the moon" President Kennedy's address to Congress commits the nation to landing Americans on the moon before 1970, initiating Project Apollo.  JFK Library - Presidential Address Transcript  July 20, 1969 Apollo 11 Lunar Landing  "The Eagle has landed" Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin land the Lunar Module in the Sea of Tranquility, spending 21.5 hours on the surface.  NASA Apollo 11 Mission Archives  1976 First Major Conspiracy Publication  "We Never Went to the Moon" Former Rocketdyne employee Bill Kaysing self-publishes the first comprehensive moon hoax theory, selling over 100,000 copies.  Smithsonian Magazine Analysis  2001 Fox Television Special  "Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon?" Fox's hour-long documentary presents alleged evidence of fakery to mainstream audiences, significantly boosting conspiracy theories.  New York Times Review  2009 Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter  Apollo Sites Photographed NASA's orbiter captures high-resolution images showing lunar modules, equipment trails, and astronaut footpaths at all six landing sites.  NASA LRO Mission Images. and then science rebuttals for all the reasons people beleive its fake like this:  Waving Flag Explanation The flag's apparent motion results from the astronauts twisting the telescoping pole during deployment. In the moon's vacuum, with no air resistance, the flag continues oscillating longer than it would on Earth. The rippled appearance comes from a horizontal rod sewn into the top to keep the flag extended in the airless environment.  Analysis of the flag motion shows it follows damped harmonic oscillation consistent with lunar conditions. The initial energy input from the astronaut's manipulation takes nearly 40 seconds to fully dissipate—impossible to accurately simulate in Earth's atmosphere.  - Dr. David A. Kring, Lunar & Planetary Institute (Source)  Shadow Consistency The non-parallel shadows result from perspective effects on uneven terrain and the moon's lack of atmospheric diffusion. Computer analysis demonstrates all shadows converge at the vanishing point corresponding to the sun's azimuth. Secondary illumination comes from: (1) lunar surface reflectance (albedo ~0.12), (2) Earthshine during some missions, and (3) light reflecting off the lunar module's highly reflective surface.  Our photogrammetric analysis of Apollo 11 images confirms shadow angles are consistent with a single light source (the sun) when accounting for local topography. The average angular deviation is less than 1°—statistically identical to parallel.  - Dr. Philip J. Stooke, Western University (Source)  Absence of Stars The cameras were set for daylight exposure (typically 1/250s at f/11) to capture the brightly sunlit lunar surface and spacesuits. Stars are too dim to register in these short exposures—a phenomenon easily replicated in Earth photography. Astronauts reported seeing stars with dark-adapted eyes when in shadow. Modern lunar missions (Chang'e, Artemis) similarly show no stars in surface photos while capturing them in long-exposure orbital images.  At full moon, the lunar surface has an apparent magnitude of -3.5 to -4.0—over 100,000 times brighter than the brightest star (Sirius at -1.46). Proper exposure for the landscape necessarily excludes stars, just as daytime Earth photography rarely shows stars.  - Dr. Bradley E. Schaefer, Louisiana State University (Source)  Van Allen Belt Transit NASA carefully calculated trajectories to minimize radiation exposure, spending ≈1.5 hours traversing the belts at high speed. The aluminum spacecraft hull provided sufficient shielding (≈7.5 g/cm²) to reduce the dose to safe levels (≈1 rem total). Apollo dosimeters confirmed radiation exposure remained within acceptable limits (11-1,100 mrem). Subsequent research shows the actual belts are less dense than 1960s models predicted, with the most hazardous regions avoidable through proper orbital mechanics.  Our reanalysis of Apollo radiation data using modern models shows the actual dose was 0.38 rad (3.8 mGy) per transit—well below the 25 rad (250 mGy) threshold for acute radiation effects. The total mission dose was comparable to a CT scan.  - Dr. W. Robert Johnston, Radiation Physicist (Source)  Video Authenticity The Apollo footage shows physically accurate motion under lunar gravity (1.62 m/s²). Biomechanical analysis confirms the characteristic "bouncing gait" matches theoretical lunar locomotion. The dust trajectories (parabolic arcs with no atmospheric drag) are impossible to accurately simulate in Earth's atmosphere. Independent analysis of the 16mm film frame rates (12 fps) and shutter angles (180°) confirms no artificial slowing occurred—the movements appear slow due to the moon's lower gravity and the astronauts' bulky pressurized suits (83 kg on Earth).  Our motion analysis shows the astronauts' movements precisely follow ballistic trajectories predicted by lunar physics. The vertical leap heights, stride lengths, and dust plume angles are all consistent with 1/6th Earth gravity and vacuum conditions.  - Dr. John B. Charles, NASA Biophysics Office (Source)  Lunar Sample Evidence The 382 kg of returned lunar samples show unique characteristics impossible to replicate on Earth: (1) complete lack of hydrous minerals or oxidation, (2) solar wind-implanted noble gases, (3) cosmic ray exposure ages matching the lunar surface, and (4) impact-generated glass spherules with compositions matching lunar meteorites. These samples have been verified by scientists worldwide, including Soviet researchers during the Cold War. Modern analysis continues to reveal new insights, including recent discoveries of water-bearing minerals in Apollo samples using techniques unavailable in the 1970s.  The Apollo samples exhibit radiation damage, solar wind implantation, and impact features that would require technologies beyond 21st century capabilities to fabricate. Their isotopic ratios precisely match lunar meteorites but differ from all terrestrial and synthetic materials.  - Dr. Clive R. Neal, University of Notre Dame (Source) and then a small quiz at the end. Also add the feature whre if the cursor hits hte astronaut or plant it HITS them, like theres collision. and the satellite is following the cursor but its not revolving around it, and its not smooth
everything is great but the satellite isnt working, and what i meant by HIT the other things is what whenevr the cursor touches them it should be a liek a small collision, like the they go the otehr waey, and not somehitng crazy. ALso the satellite shoudl be constantly revolving aroudn the cursor and it tries to fdollow the cursor eveywhere but ti should be very smooth
